# Customer Churn
The main purpose of this project is to predict which all customers are going to churn out and which all customers might possibly stay. Using historical data we are going to train to different models like "Logistic Regression", "Decission Tree", and "Random Forest" to find out which model gives us a more aaccurate prediction.
